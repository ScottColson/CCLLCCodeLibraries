# CCLLC.Core.Net

Provides a simplified HTTP Web Request interface and implementation based on the System.Net.HttpWebRequest.
The primary reason for using this rather than the using the System.Net.HttpWebRequest directly is that 
is that it is easy to fake this implementation because it is based on an interface.
